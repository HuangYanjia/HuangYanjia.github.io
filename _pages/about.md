I am **Yanjia Huang**, an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at **Texas A&amp;M University**, advised by Prof. Zhengzhong Tu.  
My research explores how *vision-language models*, *diffusion policy learning* can be woven together to produce robust, long-horizon plans for **embodied agents**—from indoor navigation to dexterous manipulation.

**Recent highlights**

* **VISTA** — a visual-imagination scheduler that asks a diffusion model to “dream ahead” when the agent’s confidence drops.  
* **PANDORA** — a diffusion controller for robotic piano playing (IROS 2025, under review).
* **Monte-Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD)** — a planner that expands trajectories in latent diffusion space to search over goal-conditioned robot motions.  


Outside the lab you’ll find me at a piano, on a hiking trail, or cycling.

> *“Robots shouldn’t just react; they should **imagine**, **reason**, and **plan**.”*

Have a collaboration idea or just want to chat? Shoot me an email—coffee’s on me.
